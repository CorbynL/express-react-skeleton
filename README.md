### You'll need to create a mongo database if you want to expreience this website in it's complete and perfect form.  

Create it with love.  Affectionately caress it every night.  Send it to a good school.  Set it on the right path, only for it to rebel and join a punk rock band that only ever played at the local bar.  Steadily degrade your relationship with the database.  Watch it move out in a fit of rage when it turns 18.  Watch it get involved with the wrong crowds.  Drug addiction, questionable partners, homelessness, rock-bottem, redemtion.  Realise that you're writing your own version of 177013 with a database as the main charactor. Rethink life. ~ fin
